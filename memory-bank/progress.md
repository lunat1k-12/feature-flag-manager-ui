# Project Progress

## Current Status
The React Dashboard Application is progressing well through the data integration phase. The core UI structure and components have been implemented, and we've added a mock API client to simulate backend data fetching. The dashboard now displays dynamic data with loading states and error handling. The application uses React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a modern development approach, with the Context API for state management.

## What Works
1. **Basic Application Structure**: Core project setup with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2. **Layout Components**: 
   - Layout component with proper structure
   - Collapsible sidebar with navigation menu
   - Header with tab navigation
   - Content area that changes based on selected tab
3. **State Management**: Context API implementation for managing application state
4. **Responsive Design**: Basic responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Dashboard Overview**: Dynamic dashboard widgets and metrics display with mock data
6. **Tab Navigation**: Synchronized tab switching between header and sidebar
7. **Mock API Integration**: 
   - API client with simulated network requests
   - TypeScript interfaces for data models
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Data fetching triggered by tab changes
8. **Data Display**: Dynamic rendering of metrics, activity items, analytics, and reports

## What's Left to Build
1. **Authentication System**: User login, registration, and authentication flow
2. **Backend API Integration**: Connection to real backend APIs when available
3. **Dashboard Widgets**: Advanced data visualization components and charts
4. **Analytics Section**: Enhanced analytics views with filtering and sorting
5. **Reports Section**: Report generation and export functionality
6. **Settings Section**: User preferences and application configuration options
7. **Notifications System**: Real-time notifications and alerts
8. **User Profile**: User profile management and personalization
9. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced responsive design for mobile devices
10. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Known Issues
1. **Content Transitions**: No transition effects when switching between tabs
2. **Responsive Edge Cases**: Some layout issues on certain screen sizes
3. **State Persistence**: User preferences like sidebar state are not persisted between sessions
4. **Loading Performance**: Initial data loading could be optimized with better caching
5. **Error Recovery**: Error states need better recovery mechanisms
6. **Accessibility**: Not fully tested for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Project Timeline
1. **Phase 1** (Current): Core UI implementation and structure - COMPLETED
2. **Phase 2**: Data integration and dynamic content - IN PROGRESS
3. **Phase 3**: Authentication and user management - PLANNED
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimizations - PLANNED
5. **Phase 5**: Testing, refinement, and deployment - PLANNED

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Initial Plan**: Simple component structure with prop drilling
- **Current Approach**: Context API for state management with clear component hierarchy
- **Future Consideration**: Potential adoption of more robust state management if complexity increases

### Styling Approach
- **Initial Plan**: CSS Modules for component styling
- **Current Approach**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Future Consideration**: Potential extraction of common patterns into reusable classes

### Component Organization
- **Initial Plan**: Organization by component type
- **Current Approach**: Organization by feature/function
- **Future Consideration**: Potential further modularization as application grows

## Metrics & Milestones
1. **Core UI Implementation**: 100% complete
2. **Responsive Design**: 70% complete
3. **State Management**: 80% complete
4. **Data Integration**: 70% complete (mock API implemented)
5. **Authentication**: 0% complete
6. **Testing Coverage**: 0% complete

## Next Milestone Target
Implement authentication system and protected routes by end of next sprint.
