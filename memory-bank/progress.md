## Evolution Notes

### Architecture Evolution
The project started with a focus on clean architecture and has successfully implemented:
- Modern React patterns with hooks and context
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular API structure for scalability
- Component composition for reusability

### Decision Evolution
Key decisions that have proven successful:
- React Context over external state management (appropriate for current complexity)
- Modal-based CRUD operations (consistent UX)
- Environment-first data model (matches real-world usage)
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

### Learning & Insights
- OAuth/OIDC integration complexity requires careful configuration
- Environment-scoped data model simplifies access control
- Modal patterns work well for CRUD operations in this context
- TypeScript interfaces provide excellent API contract documentation
