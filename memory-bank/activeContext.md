# Active Context - Feature Flag UI

## Current Project State
The Feature Flag UI is a **functional React application** with core infrastructure in place. The application has been built with modern React patterns and includes authentication, routing, and basic CRUD operations for feature flag management.

## What's Currently Working

### âœ… Authentication System
- OAuth/OIDC integration via `react-oidc-context`
- Protected route system with automatic redirects
- User context management throughout the app
- Login/logout flow with callback handling

### âœ… Core Application Structure
- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite setup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router DOM v6 for navigation
- ESLint configuration for code quality

### âœ… State Management
- Centralized app state via React Context (`AppContext`)
- Global state for navigation, loading, errors, and data
- Custom hooks for type-safe context access
- Efficient state updates and loading management

### âœ… API Integration Layer
- Modular API client with authentication
- Standardized response format (`ApiResponse<T>`)
- Environment-specific endpoint structure
- User token injection for authenticated requests

### âœ… Component Architecture
- Layout system with sidebar navigation
- Modal components for create/edit operations
- Content components for different sections
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### âœ… Feature Flag Management
- Environment-based feature flag organization
- **Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
- Modal-based flag creation, updating, and deletion
- Environment-specific flag listing
- **Feature flag editing with read-only name field**

### âœ… Environment Management
- Multiple environment support
- Environment selection and switching
- Environment creation via modal
- Environment-specific data loading

### âœ… API Key Management
- Environment-scoped API key generation
- API key listing and management
- Key deletion capabilities
- Programmatic access support

## Current Focus Areas

### ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Refinement
The application has all core functionality but may benefit from:
- Enhanced loading states and transitions
- Better error messaging and recovery
- Improved responsive design
- Accessibility improvements

### ðŸŽ¯ Feature Completeness
Core features are implemented but could be enhanced:
- **âœ… Feature flag editing (COMPLETED - full CRUD operations)**
- Bulk operations for flags
- Flag usage analytics
- Advanced flag configurations (targeting, rollout percentages)

### ðŸŽ¯ Developer Experience
The codebase is well-structured but could benefit from:
- Additional TypeScript strict mode configurations
- More comprehensive error boundaries
- Performance optimizations
- Testing infrastructure

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Context-Driven Architecture
The app uses React Context as the primary state management solution:
```typescript
// Centralized state in AppContext
const context = useAppContext();
// Access to all app state and actions
const { environments, selectedEnvironment, setActiveTab } = context;
```

### Environment-Centric Data Flow
All data operations are scoped to the selected environment:
```typescript
// Data loads based on selected environment
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedEnvironment) {
    refreshFeatureFlags(selectedEnvironment);
  }
}, [selectedEnvironment]);
```

### Modal-Based CRUD Operations
Create, update, and delete operations use modal dialogs:
- `AddEnvironmentModal` for environment creation
- `AddFeatureFlagModal` for flag creation
- **`UpdateFeatureFlagModal` for flag editing**
- `DeleteFeatureFlagModal` for flag deletion

### Protected Route Pattern
All application routes require authentication:
```typescript
<ProtectedRoute>
  <Layout />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

## Recent Architectural Decisions

### 1. React Context Over External State Management
**Decision**: Use React Context API instead of Redux/Zustand
**Rationale**: 
- Simpler setup for current app complexity
- Built-in React solution
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Sufficient for current state management needs

### 2. Modular API Structure
**Decision**: Organize API by feature domains (environment, flags, keys)
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to extend with new features
- Consistent patterns across endpoints
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Modal-Based UI Patterns
**Decision**: Use modals for create/edit operations
**Rationale**:
- Maintains context while editing
- Consistent user experience
- Easier state management
- Mobile-friendly approach

### 4. Environment-First Data Model
**Decision**: All feature flags and API keys are scoped to environments
**Rationale**:
- Matches real-world usage patterns
- Prevents cross-environment data leaks
- Simplifies access control
- Clear data organization

### 5. Feature Flag Update Implementation
**Decision**: Implement update functionality using same API endpoint as create
**Rationale**:
- Reuses existing API infrastructure
- Backend handles create vs update logic
- Consistent with existing patterns
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
**Implementation Details**:
- `UpdateFeatureFlagModal` component with read-only FF Name field
- Pre-populates form with existing flag data
- Supports both SIMPLE and PERCENTAGE flag types
- Uses same `createFeatureFlag` API call
- Automatic data refresh after successful updates

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### 1. Authentication Configuration
The app uses OIDC but requires proper configuration for production:
- OIDC provider settings
- Redirect URI configuration
- Token refresh handling
- Logout cleanup

### 2. API Backend Integration
The frontend is ready but needs backend API:
- Environment CRUD endpoints
- Feature flag management endpoints
- API key generation and management
- User authentication integration

### 3. Error Handling Robustness
Current error handling is basic:
- Generic error messages
- Limited error recovery options
- No offline handling
- Basic validation feedback

## Next Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Backend API Integration**: Connect to actual feature flag service
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better user feedback and recovery
3. **Production Authentication**: Configure OIDC for production environment

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, memoization improvements
2. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
4. **Advanced Flag Features**: Targeting rules, rollout percentages

### Low Priority
1. **Analytics Dashboard**: Flag usage metrics and insights
2. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch operations
3. **Export/Import**: Configuration backup and restore
4. **Audit Logging**: Track changes and user actions

## Development Environment Notes
- **Node.js**: Modern version required for React 19
- **Package Manager**: Both npm and yarn lock files present
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server on default port
- **Build Process**: TypeScript compilation + Vite bundling
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with React-specific rules

## Memory Bank Maintenance
This activeContext.md file should be updated when:
- Major features are completed or modified
- Architectural decisions are made
- New challenges or blockers are identified
- Development priorities change
- Integration points are established
