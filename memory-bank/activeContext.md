# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently in the data integration phase. The core UI components and application structure have been established, and we've implemented a mock API client to simulate backend data fetching. The dashboard now displays dynamic data from the mock API with loading states and error handling. The sidebar and header navigation are fully synchronized, and the content area updates based on the selected tab.

## Recent Changes
1. Set up the basic project structure with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2. Implemented the AppContext for state management
3. Created core layout components (Layout, Sidebar, Header, Content)
4. Added responsive design with collapsible sidebar functionality
5. Implemented tab-based navigation in the header
6. Created mock API client with simulated network requests
7. Added data fetching and loading states to the AppContext
8. Updated components to use dynamic data from the mock API
9. Synchronized sidebar menu items with header tabs

## Next Steps
1. **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and protected routes
2. **Dashboard Widgets**: Develop reusable chart and data visualization components
3. **Settings Page**: Create user preference and configuration options
4. **Responsive Refinements**: Optimize mobile experience and tablet layouts
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for components
6. **API Integration**: Replace mock API with real backend API when available

## Active Decisions & Considerations
1. **State Management Scale**: Currently using React Context API for state management. Monitoring complexity to determine if a more robust solution like Redux will be needed as the application grows.
2. **Component Granularity**: Balancing component size and reusability. Currently favoring slightly larger components for clarity, but may refactor into smaller pieces as patterns emerge.
3. **Styling Approach**: Using Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in components. Considering extraction of common patterns into component classes if repetition increases.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Watching for potential performance bottlenecks, especially with conditional rendering and context updates.
5. **Accessibility**: Need to ensure all components meet accessibility standards, particularly for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
1. **Component Structure**: Components are organized by feature/function rather than by type
2. **State Updates**: Prefer immutable state updates using functional updates when referencing previous state
3. **TypeScript Usage**: Strong typing for all components, props, and state
4. **CSS Approach**: Tailwind utility classes with dynamic class application based on state
5. **Naming Conventions**: 
   - PascalCase for component files and function components
   - camelCase for variables, functions, and instances
   - Descriptive, action-based names for event handlers (e.g., handleClick, toggleSidebar)

## Learnings & Project Insights
1. **Context API Effectiveness**: React Context API is working well for the current scope of state management needs
2. **Tailwind Efficiency**: Tailwind CSS is enabling rapid UI development with consistent styling
3. **Component Composition**: The current component hierarchy is effective but may need refinement as the application grows
4. **TypeScript Benefits**: TypeScript is catching potential issues early and improving code quality
5. **Responsive Challenges**: Managing responsive layouts with a collapsible sidebar requires careful coordination of state and CSS

## Current Challenges
1. **Content Transitions**: Adding smooth transitions when switching between different content sections
2. **Dynamic Content Height**: Managing content area height with variable content while maintaining a clean layout
3. **State Persistence**: Need to implement state persistence for user preferences like sidebar collapsed state
4. **Error Handling**: Improving error handling for API requests
5. **Loading States**: Optimizing loading states and adding skeleton loaders for better UX
