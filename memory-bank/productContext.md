# Product Context - Feature Flag UI

## Problem Statement
Development teams need a centralized, user-friendly way to manage feature flags across multiple environments. Without proper tooling, feature flag management becomes:
- Error-prone (manual configuration files)
- Inconsistent across environments
- Difficult for non-technical stakeholders to manage
- Lacking proper access controls and audit trails

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Product Managers**: Need to enable/disable features without technical intervention
- **Developers**: Need to create and configure feature flags during development
- **DevOps Engineers**: Need to manage environment-specific configurations

### Secondary Users
- **QA Engineers**: Need to test different feature combinations
- **Support Teams**: Need visibility into feature states for troubleshooting

## User Journey

### Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to application
2. Redirected to OAuth/OIDC provider for authentication
3. After successful auth, redirected back to main application
4. User gains access to feature flag management interface

### Environment Management
1. User selects or creates an environment (dev, staging, prod)
2. Environment becomes the context for all subsequent operations
3. User can switch between environments as needed

### Feature Flag Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: User creates a new feature flag with name and description
2. **Configuration**: User sets initial state (enabled/disabled) per environment
3. **Management**: User can toggle flags on/off as needed
4. **Cleanup**: User can delete flags that are no longer needed

### API Key Management
1. User generates API keys for programmatic access
2. Keys are scoped to specific environments
3. Applications use these keys to query feature flag states
4. User can revoke keys when no longer needed

## Value Proposition

### For Product Teams
- **Faster iteration**: Toggle features without deployments
- **Risk mitigation**: Gradual rollouts and quick rollbacks
- **A/B testing**: Easy feature variation management

### For Development Teams
- **Simplified deployments**: Deploy code with features disabled
- **Environment consistency**: Same codebase, different configurations
- **Debugging support**: Quickly isolate feature-related issues

### For Operations Teams
- **Centralized control**: Single source of truth for feature states
- **Audit trails**: Track who changed what and when
- **API integration**: Programmatic access for CI/CD pipelines

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in deployment-related incidents
- Faster feature rollout cycles
- Increased non-technical user adoption
- Improved environment configuration consistency
- Reduced time to resolve feature-related issues

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive**: Non-technical users can manage flags without training
- **Fast**: Operations complete in under 3 clicks
- **Reliable**: Clear feedback for all actions (success, error, loading)
- **Accessible**: Works across devices and screen sizes
- **Secure**: Proper authentication and authorization controls
